Higher Power,ARGY (아르지),"Am I closer? Have I lost my mind?
The sun is burning me
Is it broken? There's a rift in time
Should I take defeat?

Even if I find a higher power
Something tells me it won't be enough
And even if this desert starts to flower
I'll still find a way to spill my blood

I think I lost my mind
I feel a rift in time
I think I lost my mind

Am I closer? Have I lost my mind?
The sun is burning me
Is it broken? There's a rift in time
Should I take defeat

Even if I find a higher power
Something tells me it won't be enough

Angel,CHANMINA (챤미나),"まだ寂しいのは君のせいでもないよ
誰かを想い歌を歌う夜

You said you're the one
でもずっとどこか落ち着かない
このままだとあなたは私を恋しがるでしょう

(涙よ踊れ) 鳴呼あなたとの夜は暖かい
でも未だに心は冷えますね
(共に踊れ) ほらこのまま2人血が繋がる
ほど心を込めて愛をしましょう
(涙よ踊れ)

あなたはまだわかってない
寂しそうに見えるといつも言うだけで
Do you wanna marry me? yesとも違うでしょ
何がしたいのよ
過去の罪を覗きに
何が善悪もないよ
もう最後まで行こうよ
Look at me, look at me, look at me

You said 少しだけ落ち着いて
傷を付けたくないと抱きしめる
未だに私をよく知らないみたいね

(涙よ踊れ) 鳴呼あなたとの夜は暖かい
でも未だに心は冷えますね
(共に踊れ) ほらこのまま2人血が繋がる
ほど心を込めて愛をしましょう
(涙よ踊れ)

Angel みたいに飛び回るの
悪魔みたいにしがみついて (共に踊れ)
Angel みたいに飛び回るの
2人が死ぬまで死ぬまで (涙よ踊れ)

Look at my wings 破れてるの
あなたがしてきた全ての事たちが今
私を贈ったみたいだね
ねぇダーリン泣いてみせて
善も悪も当然
報いを受けるんだよ
私は消せないよ

(涙よ踊れ) 嗚呼あなたの涙を忘れません
まだ私の心はありますか？
(共に踊れ) もうどれほど愚かと言われても
また雨の夜にはおいでください
(涙よ踊れ)

Angel みたいに飛び回るの
悪魔みたいにしがみついて (共に踊れ)
Angel みたいに飛び回るの
私が死ぬまで騙して踊るの (涙よ踊れ)

Never Grow Up,CHANMINA (챤미나),"何から話せばいい
長い長い our story
最後になりそうだね
ありがとう愛してた
何が愛か知らない
だから二人で愛を作ったんだ
これでいいのかなんて
私に聞かないでよね
Yeah we are always high
惹かれあってた
あなたがピーターで
私がウェンディを演じた

そばにいる事にも慣れ
いない事にも慣れてた
ねぇ君が好きって again and again
また離れて again and again
また戻るの again and again

狂わせた時計と壊れたコンパスが
私たちを大人にさせない
繰り返してる最後のキス あぁ
まだここにいる we never never grow up

We are never never grow up
二人とも気付いてはいたけど
歪み始めていた love
君の目を見てわかっちゃった
ねえなんなんだよわかってくれよ
とか決してそんな荒い気持ちじゃない
君のさよならが重い言葉に
聞こえなくなったんだよ

こんな事言いたくない
けど君しか知らないからさ
行かないでって again and again
もう消えてって again and again
愛してるって again and again

狂わせた時計と壊れたコンパスが
私たちを大人にさせない
繰り返してる最後のキス あぁ
まだここにいる we never never grow up

長かったね愛してたよねもう終わりにしよう
We are never growing up (長かったね)
過ぎ去ってく日々たちを (愛してたよね)
忘れたわけじゃない (もう)
消したいわけじゃない (終わりにしよう)
いつかはこんなにも悲しい夜が
来ることなんか最初からわかってた
いつもとは違うほんとのほんとの

PAIN IS BEAUTY,CHANMINA (챤미나),"昔と変わらない今もlonely girl
何度も現れるこの十字路
その度にまた選ばされる未来
目に見えない yes or no 選べ""らしさ""を

誰もわかってくれないしどうせ
傷付きたくないのやめて
理解してよなんて言えないから
睨みつけたんだ

周りの評価がすべてで
だけど言いたくないのデタラメ
少しだけでいいから何かに
守られたくてなぜか
長袖を着て歩いた
強くなれた気がした

誰も近寄ってくんな
嘘だらけの言葉
ここから抜け出せれば
I can do anything so i said

Go away ほっといて
怖くないって顔してさ
強がってみたかったんだ
強そうに見えたかな

So try me, I love the pain
今になってやっと知った
痛みって美しいんだ
私を綺麗にしたんだ
Pain is beauty

世間はいつでも冷たかった
私にだけは常識を求めんな
こうであるべきとか絶対ないから
コンプレックスを抱きしめて羽ばたいた
戦ってみせてよ baby
疲れたらここにおいで
そう大切な人達にそんな歌を歌っていたい

ありきたりな言葉達が
やけに胸にささる時は
このまま このまま 痛みだけを感じたい
聞き覚えのある曲達
何気なく歌ってたのに
こんなにこんなに大切なものだったなんて

愛されていたのに
気がつけてなかった
もうなに言われてもいいや
Go and hate me all you want

強がってみたかったんだ

So try me, I love the pain

信用してるわけないじゃんか
この先の事なんて
Nobody knows, Nobody Knows
君だっていつも言うじゃん
先なんて どうなってもいいじゃん？
そんな君に恋して手を取る
そんな私も少しだけイカれてる

二人の世界
ここはパラダイス
もう抜け出せないや
何も問題ないよ
私は All right
なのに残ってんだ
ボイスメモの No.5

彼はとても意地悪だ
地獄みたいなスマイル
嘘も普通に言う
But every time I'm so into you
私の首にキスしては
他の子にまだ興味がある
怖くて仕方ない
But maybe 'couse I'm perfect for you
For you, For you
For you, For you
Maybe 'couse I'm perfect for you
For you, For you
For you, For you
Maybe 'couse I'm perfect for you

彼はとても意地悪だ
この先飽きる気がしない
嘘みたいなキスが
たまらなく愛しい
約束は苦手でも
どこにも行かないでいて
そのままの君でいてね
Maybe 'couse I'm perfect for you",,,

Hope This Song Is for You,CHRISTOPHER (크리스토퍼),"Just like an ocean has its waves
I've done things I just can't change
And just like clouds are full of rain
I carry with me all this extra weight, I've got to let it drain

If you have nothing to die for
What are you even alive for?
Yeah, there's birds in the trees
And they're singing for me when the night falls
That the sunrise won't be nothing like yesterday

And you can call me fool
But I hope this song's for you
If it's not quite enough
I'll find another line or two
If I just had someone
To sing it to

I keep a voice inside my head
Reminding me how much I regret
Just like a thunder has its strike
Every time I'm clean, I go and fuck it up
It's a habit of mine

Irony,CHRISTOPHER (크리스토퍼),"I'm still smoking 'cause I read somewhere
If I quit before I'm twenty-six
I'll be fine so I'm lying to myself
While I light another cigarette
I'm addicted to my phone
Getting anxious every time that it's out of reach
I lie awake, screen right up in my face
And I wonder why I can't sleep

Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?

I saw these awful things in a documentary
Decided I would stop eating meat
To save the planet 'til I was like ""damn it""
I didn't even last a week
So pretty perfect on the surface, but the truth is
I don't wanna be that guy
But I got a script, better stick to it
My label's telling me I gotta lie

Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?
And nobody's perfect under the surface
They'll never see that side of me
Oh, can you see the irony?

I just got a new tattoo, I'm embarrassed
'Cause I didn't even tell my own mom
So every time I'm home visiting my parents
I always keep my sweater on
I don't care if it's the truth or not

Reading the comments like everybody's honest
While they're cheering for my fake life

And I wonder why I can't sleep

Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?

I saw these awful things in a documentary
Decided I would stop eating meat
To save the planet 'til I was like ""damn it""
I didn't even last a week
So pretty perfect on the surface, but the truth is
I don't wanna be that guy
But I got a script, better stick to it
My label's telling me I gotta lie

Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?
And nobody's perfect under the surface
They'll never see that side of me
Oh, can you see the irony?

I just got a new tattoo, I'm embarrassed
'Cause I didn't even tell my own mom
So every time I'm home visiting my parents
I always keep my sweater on
I don't care if it's the truth or not
All I care about is gettin' likes
Reading the comments like everybody's honest
While they're cheering for my fake life

Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?
And nobody's perfect under the surface
They'll never see that side of me
Oh, can you see the irony?

'Cause I'm only human after all
Put a filter on and it make it look natural
'Cause I'm only human after all
Put a filter on and it make it look natural
Can you see the irony?
Oh, can't you see the irony?

But everybody's tryna be
Can you see the irony?

She wanted all night
She wanted get it with me
She wanted all night
She wanted f with me
She wanted all night
Yeah!
She wanted all night
Yeah!

Here's goes a story about a bad chick
And she got a habit
Fast cars, and money, and she living lavish
I mean I really get, you are magic
And I ain't talking tricks, no thrills, no rabbit
Now usually I'm not the one to go chasing
But here's a really sticky situation
It's not that complicated
'Cause neither one of us need a conversation
I just want the honey, and she wants the invitation

She wants the red carpet, I'ma roll it out
She's the type of model that I dream about
Let me open up the door like you'd wear a crown
and we can fool around!

Beauty Queen, jump on my limousine
And ride it aaaa-all night long, aaaa-all night long
It's so fantastic even when there's traffic
Driving aaaa-all night long, aaaa-all night long

She wanted all night
She wanted get it with me
She wanted all night
She wanted f with me
She wanted all night
Yeah!
She wanted all night

Now, let's fast forward just a little bit
Been about a month or two, and I'm really feeling it
I can't live without it, she's addicted to the d
Tell she's in heaven when she's looking at me
But I don't really blame her 'cause I give it to her good
Give it to her strong like it's made out of wood
Got the girl craving!
She even staring downtown when I'm shaving
Telling ""It's amazing!""
""He's like so awesome!""

Everything about her is tripled-up
Like they ain't in it
I can see her freak though the chill it's kinda innocent
Shinning though she lowkey, worth the hella money
I can spot the heat like my vision's on the infrared
She like the sprinkle on a cake
She the cheese on a burger
The roll in my stake
She the bee to my nectar
I've been stunned
'Cause you're the one I've dream about forever
I would really like to know you, baby
I would really like to please you!

今日も怒られる

「おいおい 口ばっか動かさず手動かせ
あー言えばこー言う屁理屈やめい
余計なことばっか考えんな
早よせぇ早よせぇ コラ余所見はだめ」

悪者扱いして来た街で
悪者扱いして来たオトナへ
変わりゆく俺、鏡の中へ
尋ねても答えならyeah yeah yeah
去る者追わない引くとこ引いて
丸く収めたり軽くいなして
鏡の中でわろてるお前
括れやしなかったわ。たったの三文字で
日々重くなる足取りで
自分の歩幅で闊歩してる
カマすとこカマす
まかすとこまかす
割と適当な段取りで
やっと分かって来たかも
このポンコツの操縦の仕方を

他人に期待をしないのが今の俺の強み
手負いでも進める距離なら行くぜ騙し騙し
身の程を知るほどに
胸を張りいつも通り
でも時にしたって良い背伸び
やっと「大人気ない」が出来る年
小さな枠組み ただの数字
縛られずにでも腹くくり
あの日の俺が立ち止まる

ガキの頃から夜が好きだった
9時に寝るのは何か嫌だった
なんと無くただ勿体無かった
お前の事がもっと知りたかった
いわゆる三文の得
投げ売ってでも見たいのさ もっと奥の奥の奥
色濃く紐解く
12オクロックから丑の刻まで
初めてお前を跨いだのは、
いや初めて跨ったのは確か14
俺は何も知らねワナビー
手取り足取り全てが新しい
姿形にその香り
静けさが似合うその黒い肌に
吸い込まれてた 手招きされるままに
それからお前は音楽をくれた
女の裸も見せてくれた
飲んだ事ねぇ酒に口つけて
オトンのタバコくすね火を付けた
やっちゃいけないが溢れて
知っちゃいけないに塗れてる
迎えに来る闇に紛れて
お前はいつも気まぐれで...

Promise Her the Moon,Eric Martin (에릭 마틴),"You don't know what you got
Till the love is almost gone
This time she's given up
Still in a state of shock
I should have seen it coming on
It's too late for waking up
Her mind's made up I know
The dream is over
But my heart just can't let go
She's too good to be forgotten
Too good to be true
Before my world is torn apart
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon
I was too blind to notice her
Wrapped up in myself
Working hard overtime, night and day
I thought we were so secure
Can't imagine someone else
Could come between us and take her away
Her mind's made up I know
The dream is over
But my heart just can't let go
She's too good to be forgotten
Too good to be true
Before my world is torn apart
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon
And all the times that she stood by me
I never said I love you
But I kept it deep down in my soul
And all the while I've been a fool",,,

Shine,Eric Martin (에릭 마틴),"Everybody got their eye on the prize
Wants to know what it's like
To be on top of the world
Think it's all money and fame
It's just a game
But it's more than denim and pearls
It's a real man's world
And I ain't lyin'

Grip tighter and you get a deep seat
Turn out your feet
Get your hooks in, let it go
Feel the power straight out the gate
But it ain't too late
Roll your hips son
Get back in the flow
Eight seconds is a long damn time

It's more than the shine in the buckle
Broken hearts, busted knuckles
You know you gotta hustle
You're sifting through the rubble to find
Your soul's on the line, and you're runnin' behind
It's more than the shine

Sometimes you land on your feet or accept defeat
Pick yourself up, get back on again
Most nights you lie awake as your body aches
Knowing you've lost more than you'll win
Please, God, just give me a sign

This life's been a hard, go out on the road
Chasin' this damn rodeo
The woman I love stays on my mind

Family Song,Gen Hoshino (호시노 겐),"目が覚めて涎を拭いたら

すべてを残さずに 綺麗にいなくなり
愛も傷も 海の砂に混ざり
きらきら波間に反射する

今のうちに 旅をしよう 僕らは
悲しみにひらひらと手を振る
窓を開けて 風に笑み
意味なく生きては 陽射しを浴びている

過去 背なに雨 目の前には
まだ知らぬ景色

惹かれ合うのは なぜ
ただ「見て 綺麗」だと手を引いた
海にゆれる 光の跡
消えてゆくのに なぜ
ただ 忘れたくない思い出を
増やすのだろう
ほら 終わりは 未来だ

繋ぐその手 やがて解けゆく
足跡はいつしか 止まるはず
それはまるで 訳もなく輝く
貴方の笑顔の意味と知る

この街を出てゆくときは
何一つ持たなくても
昨日のことはいつの日か
思い出すに違いない

彼はいま列車の上で
あの町を遠くから眺めて
ほつれたマフラーの隅っこをくわえて
野球のこととか考える

今夜も

新しい日が僕らを待ちわびて
色褪せていく思い出も沢山あるけど

君は今遠くの町で
あの日々をアルバムに閉じ込めて
ぼやけた頭の隅っこの空白で
テレビのこととか考える

美しい

言葉や笑顔だけが少しずつ上手になって
忘れてくこともある、けれど
変わらないものだってある

痛みなら少しは知ってる

格好悪くたってもう一度手を伸ばすよ
迷う理由はどこにもなかった
愛をしてるから祈っているんだ

神様がくれたノートに載ってない未来
多分怖いのは他の誰かよりも
今の幸せにしがみつく自分

強く生きなくちゃ守れないよな
でも陰では泣いてもいいよな

伝わらなくても叫びつづけさせてよ
正しさなんてどうでもよかった

Look, girl, you got me faded
Like I down the whole bottle
Yeah, you walked in the room
Looking like a Victoria Secret model
Throw your number in my iPhone
And then let me take you home
I swear, I think I fell in love
Either that or my drink's too strong

Took a walk on the clouds, better sleep on the moon
And I'm not coming down, now that I'm with you
If we ever wake up, don't know what I would do
Are we really in love or dazed and confused?

Ba da ba da ba da ba da ba da
Got me feeling like
Ba da ba da ba da ba da ba da ba da

You taking selfies with your girls
And dancing with your ass out
The way you drop it down low
I swear you got me 'bout to pass out
Feeling tipsy, every time you kiss me
Girl, you got me high, yeah, this love we got is trippy
But it's all good, we just dazed and confused
Wake up in the morning, what the hell do we do?

I hope you still remember what I look like
I haven't seen you in a minute
Last night I had the kind of dream that you just don't wanna wake up from
and that's cause you were in it
So this morning when I woke up it felt more like a nightmare cause when I rolled over I thought you'd be right there but nope
I'm just laying here alone
on my own wishing I was on the first flight home

I'll be home in no time
I promise when I touch down it'll be like I never left singing
I'll be home in no time
By the way check your phone cause I just sent you a text saying

Hey I know I've been gone forever,
I'm coming home tonight
We'll be back together this plane gone fly
I can't predict the weather
But you should know that I
I'll be on the first flight home
I'll be on the first flight home

And I bet if I left right now
I'd probably make it to you by the morning
So I'm packing up my bags hopping on this red eye
I'll be there before your eyes even open
Hurry up and tell the pilot to take off
So we could pick up right where we left off
I can't believe it I'm finally on my way
Feels so damm good to be able to say

Been a while since I've been on this block
And now I walk up to your front door
I know you recognize that same knock
I hear you running down the stairs now
Tears running down your face
Then you open up that front door
And I look at your and say

I won't never let you go
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, baby, every single day
I'ma let you know

I won't never let you go
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, baby, every single day
I'ma let you know, oh, oh
You're my everything

It started back in middle school, back when it was puppy love
Now it's so much more than that, it's somethin' I've been dreamin' of
It's crazy lookin' back, thinkin' back when we were kids
But it's funny 'cause my feelings for you haven't changed a bit

I remember growin' up, lookin' at my mom and dad
Thinkin' when I'm older, that's exactly what I wanna have
And I think I finally found it, ever since the day you came along
I never doubted us, I swear I knew it early on

Baby, you're my best friend, yeah, I hope you know
We'll go down together just like dominoes
They say there's no such thing as fairy tales, but this seems to be

Yeah, remember layin' on my roof, lookin' at the stars
I pointed to the biggest one and said, ""That one is ours""
You ain't just a random girl, now, we go way back
Always doin' laps around my mind like a racetrack

I've been chasin' after you ever since I was five foot
Circlin' your picture with a sharpie in my yearbook
That might have sounded kinda creepy, yeah, it's cheesy, but it's true
Girl, I swear that you complete me

'Cause you're everything I wanted more, never felt like this before
Lookin' in your eyes sends chills down my spinal cord
I can only pray to God, you feel the same
Yeah, girl, I love you, that will never change

Now it's so much more than that, it's somethin' I've been dreamin' of
It's crazy lookin' back, thinkin' back when we were kids
But it's funny 'cause my feelings for you haven't changed a bit

I remember growin' up, lookin' at my mom and dad
Thinkin' when I'm older, that's exactly what I wanna have
And I think I finally found it, ever since the day you came along
I never doubted us, I swear I knew it early on

Baby, you're my best friend, yeah, I hope you know

Yeah, remember layin' on my roof, lookin' at the stars
I pointed to the biggest one and said, ""That one is ours""
You ain't just a random girl, now, we go way back
Always doin' laps around my mind like a racetrack

I've been chasin' after you ever since I was five foot
Circlin' your picture with a sharpie in my yearbook
That might have sounded kinda creepy, yeah, it's cheesy, but it's true
Girl, I swear that you complete me

'Cause you're everything I wanted more, never felt like this before
Lookin' in your eyes sends chills down my spinal cord
I can only pray to God, you feel the same
Yeah, girl, I love you, that will never change

Reach for the starlight
Reach when it calls you
You, you are the reason
If you want
You are the answer in the end
La La La's...
Sweet music, and your secret heart
Both have the healing grace
Sweet music, and your secret heart
Both have the healing grace
So, again, a change, it comes
Our world desires a way
Touch a child, who's lost, afraid,
It lifts you to true emotion
True feelings, be the light
All that is good in this life
Is good, good is good
Oh everlasting dream, Oh future come alive
To witness comes that time
I just can't help but believe in life,
All in all I just can't help but believe there is a way
For us to give, A way for us to live
A way for us, A way for us",,,
Horizon,John Carroll Kirby (존 캐럴 커비),"In amongst the rings of confusion
Silencing the thought powers one by one
It seems all so incredible
Our own ability to confuse - to sacrifice
To enlighten like a Shakespearian play
We foolish and happily hold on to sanity
While all around the pushing
And prodding of our feelings
The twisting and turning of our hearts
Displaying an almost indefinable strength
Of purpose - a reason a reason a reason
Where no reasons seems to exist
Yet, as in a vision, a voice transcending
All our imagination, jewel of life
Guiding light heralding a joyous new dawn

信じることへの不安 きみが消して
Day by day 感じられる運命 孤独とのお別れ

塞ぎ込んだ 此処からどうしようか
Suddenly きみの声で解けていく heart

誰もボクの事を
分かってくれないと
塞ぎ込んだ夜に
心溶かす 暖かい手
握り返して

誓いを胸に 希望を心に
抱いて fly to sky
今 刻んだ新しいそのキズナ

きみが居るから強くなれるんだ
Fight for you and I

きみの name 忘れないよ
またはじめから駆け出そう ボク等で
此処から change the world

Never fade away
契り交わした that day
Unconfidentでnegativeな世界がパラダイムシフト
後先なんて無視 道無き道を
仲間達と共に切り開く my story

気付いていなかった
本当の""強さ""を
気付くキッカケくれた
きみへの想い 触れた手と手
握り締めて

何があったってきみとなら
何処へだって fly to sky
揺らぐ事無い確かなこのキズナ

どんな時もボクの側に居てくれるきみ
ボクはきみに何がしてあげられるかな

誰に何を言われてもkeep movin' on
ブレない覚悟 2人の絆(band)切れない
もう逃げない 戯言捨ててturn the light on

きみの事この先もずっとずっと守るって誓うよ

揺らぐ事無い確かなこのキズナ

きみが居たから強くなれたんだ
Fight for you and I

きみのvoice チカラくれる
夜明け目指して駆け出そう
二人で
今すぐ
Change the world

I'm in icy world
精神は Really really cold
But 増えていった friend
明るくなるVision
きみとならどんな dungeonだってpiece of cake babe
ボク等なら大丈夫

どんな時もボクの側に居てくれるきみ
ボクはきみに何がしてあげられるかな

誰に何を言われてもkeep movin' on
ブレない覚悟 2人の絆(band)切れない
もう逃げない 戯言捨ててturn the light on

きみの事この先もずっとずっと守るって誓うよ

だってきみが本当の自分気付かせてくれた分
返さなきゃ no fair
だから believe me

誓いを胸に 希望を心に抱いて fly to sky
今 刻んだ新しいそのキズナ

きみが居るから強くなれるんだ
Fight for you and I

きみのname 忘れないよ
またはじめから駆け出そう
ボク等で

Change The World,MADKID (매드키드),"誰かの為ずっと
走り続けてきた

信じることへの不安 きみが消して
Day by day 感じられる運命 孤独とのお別れ

塞ぎ込んだ 此処からどうしようか
Suddenly きみの声で解けていく heart

誰もボクの事を
分かってくれないと
塞ぎ込んだ夜に
心溶かす 暖かい手
握り返して

誓いを胸に 希望を心に
抱いて fly to sky

Never fade away
契り交わした that day
Unconfidentでnegativeな世界がパラダイムシフト
後先なんて無視 道無き道を
仲間達と共に切り開く my story

I'm taking my time to think about that
戻せない位 離れていく 遠い""今まで""

But I could never sing my life
Because that's all I can do for you and I
だから今
歩きだそう we carry on

I'm waiting for dawn
Don't need to feel blue
I'm singing for you ずっと
眠れない夜も いつだって
I'll be there, I'll be there

I'm waiting for dawn
君は not alone
I'm singing for you ずっと
このままずっと
There will never be another you

永遠に側に居るって I was thinkin'
でも今は当たり前じゃないってknowin'
あの音 きみは何処？
あの夜の 出来事を また2人だけで play on

不安が襲う white night
誰のせいでもない but
憂き世から don't run away, run away
2人の理想の未来描く明晰夢のように

Together forever
I wish on a star
歩きだそう we carry on

I'm waiting for dawn
Don't need to feel blue
I'm singing for you そっと
涙を拭う様に いつだって
I'll be there, I'll be there

I'm waiting for dawn
I hold your hand
I'm singing for you ずっと

Keep us apart, it's too much to ask
We're running away
Take off your clothes and take off your mask
It's not over now, I won't leave you in the dark
Because I need you so

Can we kiss contagion on our lips?
Well, I don't care
We can touch and feel forbidden bliss
They can't stop us now, I won't let you feel alone
Because I need you so

You and me throw caution to the wind
And I will risk everything just to feel
The warmth and the voltage of your skin
If this is my last day on Earth, I just want to be with you
You are all that's true

We will kiss with poison on our lips

Symphonaire Infernus Et Spera Empyrium,My Dying Bride (마이 다잉 브라이드),"The destroying genius of idols
Will shroud the world with utter lies
Dance the cobbles, his abode named Dis
Portraits have spoken their masters distress
Icons with kisses, tell me who have seen this
Failing Enochian tapestries

Depict the prince of fallen virtues
In almost poetic rhapsody
Masturbate to the sound of the knell
The pathetic stench of dying children
Perhaps our fall is certain
Limbs entwined in absolute cotorsion

Please put off your veil
Your heart is blameless
And I shudder for knowing it

A hot May makes a fat churchyard
And Lychfowel breed in chaotic frenzy
Her cry was the saddest of all earths sounds
Trauma bites hard the hearts of kin
Swept away by a moments sadness
They say rage is a brief madness

By way of the beloveds farewell
Give back to nature what we first took
And monuments would slowly, would slowly fill
The agendas of Kings and Queens
In silence our faces, our faces bleed
The holy voice torn away by the gale

Make yourself all honey
And the flies will devour you

Love is a game where both players cheat
Gone is the tale of Hero and Leander
Women are angels, wedlock's the devil
To have and to hold, but death no longer parts

Harlots and sluts, whores of our world
Expose their stinking vaginas
Many who have no will of their own
Hold their souls towards the sinister bloom

You rich, oh, Lord of vanity
As you peddle your wears of cruelty
Dressed up so you look the part
So blind, it's ignorance you wear

Quite brutal, beyond belief
Sores that weep their septic tears
Dragged out through war torn lifetimes
And death shall feast on us all
The mills of God grind slowly
The adorable light of that which is most divine

The fascination of her shape
With mansions of awe and splendor
Elegant in simplicity
So at last your faith rewards you

Through fields enriched with pastel shade
And fragrant lavenders soft to smell
You laugh and drink wine of no great age
Nature does scent the farthest shores

Face to face your angelic host
All hopes in you imperishably kept
Is God your wish and all your dreams
If your body is frail, then yes, by all means

Make yourself all honey
And the flies will devour you",,,
Symphonaire Infernus Et Spera Empyrium,My Dying Bride (마이 다잉 브라이드),"The destroying genius of idols
Will shroud the world with utter lies
Dance the cobbles, his abode named Dis
Portraits have spoken their masters distress
Icons with kisses, tell me who have seen this
Failing Enochian tapestries

Depict the prince of fallen virtues
In almost poetic rhapsody
Masturbate to the sound of the knell
The pathetic stench of dying children
Perhaps our fall is certain
Limbs entwined in absolute cotorsion

Please put off your veil
Your heart is blameless
And I shudder for knowing it

A hot May makes a fat churchyard
And Lychfowel breed in chaotic frenzy
Her cry was the saddest of all earths sounds
Trauma bites hard the hearts of kin
Swept away by a moments sadness
They say rage is a brief madness

By way of the beloveds farewell
Give back to nature what we first took
And monuments would slowly, would slowly fill
The agendas of Kings and Queens
In silence our faces, our faces bleed
The holy voice torn away by the gale

Make yourself all honey
And the flies will devour you

Love is a game where both players cheat
Gone is the tale of Hero and Leander
Women are angels, wedlock's the devil
To have and to hold, but death no longer parts

Harlots and sluts, whores of our world
Expose their stinking vaginas
Many who have no will of their own
Hold their souls towards the sinister bloom

Dressed up so you look the part

The Light at the End of the World,My Dying Bride (마이 다잉 브라이드),"Small, a speck in the wide blue sea
'Tis the last of all the land
A dweller upon our lonesome isle
The last, lonely man?

On weary night, under stars
He'd often lay and gaze
Up towards the moon and stars
The sun's dying haze

Time and again, Orion's light
Filled our man with joy
Within the belt, he'd see his love
Remembering her voice

Such is life upon the isle
Of torment and woe
One day good, one day bad
And some days, even hope

The light at the end of the world
Burns bright for mile and mile
Yet tends the man, its golden glow
In misery all the while?

For 50 years he stands and waits
Atop the light, alone
Looking down upon his isle
The gods have made his home

A deity felt sympathy and threw our man a light
Your woman you may see again, for a single night
""I'll tend the light, for one more night with the woman whom I love""
Screamed the man, with tearful eyes, to the deity above

And so it was that very night his lover did return
To his arms and to their bed, together they did turn
In deepest love and lust and lust for life entwined they did fall
Lost within each other's arms they danced

Her hair, long and black
The dark, beauty of her eyes

Olive skin and warm embrace
Her memory never dies

Agony, like none before
Was suffered by our man

Anger raged and misery too
Like nothing ever before

His sacrifice was not so great
He insists upon the world
Again he would crime, again he would pay
For one moment with the girl

Long was the night filled with love
For them the world was done
Awoke he did to brightest light
His woman and life had gone

To his feet he leapt, to the sea he looked
To the lighthouse on the stone
The price is paid and from now on
He lives forever alone

50 years have passed since then
And not a soul has he seen
But his woman lives with him still
In every single dream

'Tis sad to hear how young love has died
To know that alone, someone has cried
But memories are ours to keep
To live again in our sleep",,,

Death all around him, the flies, the dogs, the din

Through the half-light on her body

So little of what we observe is the girl herself
Elaborate, scented coiffers
Adieu d'amour
Vast is the heir's ballroom
Let the rich give you presents
Heaven pours from her throat, as she sings and as she dances

The fumes of rich swine, honey-glazed and dripping, playing in the air
My mouth eager and wishing
But I return to this nightingale
Her hair all fiery red
Deep it is and wild
My weakness will be fed

Boys whipped on the alter of Diana
Sometimes until they died
The cunning wily merchant, and his four crippled horses

Tales told in warlike manner
The storyteller by the fire
While musing deeply on this sight, the songster stirred my desire

You are sweet and fine to listen to
Long tresses about her neck
Yet much is false
This mighty evening, I've seen no face
This is crushing me
My quill it aches

Turn loose the swans that drew my poet's craft
I'll dwell in desolate cities
You burned my wings
I leave this ode, splendid victorious through the carnage
I wanted to touch them all
I wanted to touch them all

「オ・イ・デ・ナ♡」
Are you ready?
You are cherry? GO!!!!

上がれ上げれ舞い上がれ
儚さより可憐に
乱れ乱れ乱れ咲け
誰よりも麗しく
揺れる風のざわめきが
私の髪を撫でる
言の葉に身を任せて
玉響の光に酔う

We don't need your words!!
(Gimme)Your heart!!
To hard!! More more more.!!
イカレ騒ゲバ 月モココロヨロシ

傾け傾け傾き舞え
散る花より激しく
仰げ仰げ天仰げ
水面より清らかに
零れ落ちる朝露が
私の頬を濡らす
手のひらに想い乗せて
朝焼けの光に問う

祈れ祈れ夢祈れ
これから見る景色を

上がれ上げれ舞い上がれ
儚さより可憐に
乱れ乱れ乱れ咲け
誰よりも麗しく
揺れる風のざわめきが
私の髪を撫でる
言の葉に身を任せて
玉響の光に酔う",,,

'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so Sally can wait
She knows its too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
""But don't look back in anger"" I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock n' Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

Gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom

Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

My soul slides away
""But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger""
I heard you say
At least not today",,,

And catch the silver sunlight in your hands
Come for me and set me free
Lift me up and take me where I stand

She believes in everything
And everyone, and you, and yours, and mine
I've waited for a thousand years
For you to come and blow me out of my mind

Hey Lyla!
The stars are about to fall
So what do you say, Lyla?
The world around us makes me feel so small, Lyla
If you can't hear me call, then I can't say, Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I fall

She's the queen of all I've seen
And every song and city far and near
Heaven, Hell, my mademoiselle
She ring the bell for all the world to hear

And as they land upon the shore, tell them not to fear no more

I fall into the blinding light

A magical mystery

And all in good time

My head's in the clouds but at least I'm trying
I'm outta control but I'm tied up tight

The Shock of the Lightning,Oasis (오아시스),"I'm all over my heart's desire
I feel cold, but I'm back in the fire
Out of control but I'm tied up tight
Come in, come out tonight

I'm coming up in the early morning
I feel love in the shock of the lightning
I fall into the blinding light
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight

Love is a time machine
Up on the silver screen
It's all in my mind
Love is a litany
A magical mystery

And all in good time
And all in good time
And all in good time

I got my feet on the street, but I can't stop flying
My head's in the clouds but at least I'm trying
I'm outta control but I'm tied up tight
Come in, come out tonight

There's a hole in the ground into which I'm falling
So godspeed to the sound of the pounding
I'm all into the blinding light
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight

Love is a time machine
Up on the silver screen
It's all in my mind
Love is a litany
A magical mystery

And all in good time
And all in good time
And all in good time

It's all in my mind
Love is a time machine
Up on the silver screen
And all in good time
And all in good time

So even in the darkness I can see what's for me's for me

What's mine is mine
It's so clear to see
So clear to see, yeah
I know what's for me's for me

It's mine (Oh, it's mine, it's mine)
It's mine

Blessings to my enemies

For Me,Pink Sweat$ (핑크스웨츠),"The moon don't shine bright like this often
Love pouring out like a faucet, reviving me
That pain make you cautious
And my shoes, they got mileage
My back on that wall and I'm still standing tall
'Cause even in the darkness I can see
What's for me's for me
It's mine, it's mine
It's so clear to see
So clear to see, yeah, I know what's for me's for me

It's mine
It's mine

Who am I to stop
When there's kids on the block looking up to me?
Made it look good when it was ugly
Dolce and Gabbana but the trauma still be haunting me
Add a couple commas, lead the whole gang comfortably
Know my true to mama feel like pain ain't need my company
Said I only make up time for what I want and that's what stuck with me
Hope you see the picture that I'm painting of this money tree
Trying to keep the balance, that's what humble me

I'm feeling godly
I break the chains that confine me
Light live inside me
So even in the darkness I can see what's for me's for me

What's mine is mine
It's so clear to see
So clear to see, yeah
I know what's for me's for me

It's mine (Oh, it's mine, it's mine)
It's mine

Blessings to my enemies
(It's mine) I hope that they all can see
I'm right where I'm supposed to be, yeah (It's mine), yeah
Blessings to my enemies

다채로운 삶을 살고 있어

온통 황홀한 색깔들

생기 넘치는, 순수한 낙원
그리고 세상은 계속 돌아가

기분이 너무 좋아
하늘에 수많은 별이 빛날 때

해가 눈부시게 빛날 때
기분이 너무 좋아, 그래
세상이 계속 돌아갈 때, 돌아갈 때
기분이 너무 좋아

삶이 그 어느 때보다 선명해 보여
내 안에 마법이 있는 것 같아
세상이 밝아지고 있어, 밝아지고 있어, ooh
모든 것을 걸고, 모든 것을 걸고

Lay Up,Pink Sweat$ (핑크스웨츠),"I just wanna lay up and chill
Sippin' on that Rosé, really get you in your feels
I just wanna stay up all night
Starin' in your eyes, take a deep dive in your mind

I know at my worst, you gon' ride for me
Even when it hurts, I know you'd die for me
I always put you first 'cause you're my everything
You're my everything
And I'll do the worst for your love

Really like this side of you
Don Julio, 1942, Malibu
We can take a shot or two
After this bottle is done, done, done

We had a moment, just take it and run away
We can have a rendezvous, just me and you
Grippin' on your thighs
I know you like it 'cause your eyes, they never lie
You can't keep no secrets, even if you tried
That pussy mine

You've been havin' problems tryna trust
It was 6 p.m. in Hermès
She like, ""Why you even thinkin' about sex right now?""
Are you out of your mind?
Look at my life, look where I'm at right now

I only care about time
Know you oppers irrelevant
Show me what you wanna do without tellin' it
Tell me you love it without sayin', ""I love you"" 'cause I'm over it
And you know you fuck with me the most
'Cause I videotape without even exposin' it
And I gave you them bankrolls without even fludgin' it

僕の盲点は君の焦点だ
だから君に惹かれたこと
眠る横顔に触れる
君もそうかな
そうだといいな

転がり込んできたサプライズを
⽬が覚めてすぐに⾒せたこの景⾊は
君の喜ぶ顔にボヤけた⽬的地だよ

眺える⾵景は君の背景だ
忘れるほど⼤事なこと
同じ毎⽇が同じ声が

笑っていたい時

鏡のように⾒つめ合う

可笑しくて可笑しくて

あなたが好むもの
あなたが嫌うもの

案外わがままなあなただった

ただぎゅっと力を込め握っても
隙間ができる程勝てやしない大きさで

幸せを噛み締めてる

差し込んだ白い光がずっと永く伸びて
足元を照らし続けてくれる

ANTI-HERO,SEKAI NO OWARI (세카이 노 오와리),"You know I don't give a damn about what's ""right""
Or pleasing everyone around me
Cause I know this world that brought us life
Wasn't made to keep everyone happy
The rules and laws that countries come up with
In front of me, they're all shit
'Cause there are people that I've gotta protect
And if you get in my way, you're dead

You see I'm tired of trying to justify
Every decision that I make
If it's to save the people that I stand by
You better believe what I say

""Stay in the lines, don't make a scene""
Heroes try to tell us what's right
But when push comes to shove, you'll know what I mean
I'm ready to start a fight

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
So I can save you when the time comes

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Yeah

Righteousness is a thing that I hate
Cause it doesn't do any good for anyone

君が誰かに手を差し伸べる時はイマじゃないかもしれない

こんなに静かだと閉じ込めた言葉も

雑音の中貴方の声だけ
心に溶けていく
まるでミルクを溢した様な
そんな夜

空を見上げて一人呟いた
消えて欲しいような言葉だけ
だけど心の音だけは
この雪も奪えない

クリスマスなんて無ければ
いつも通りの何にも変わらない夜なのに
聖なる旋律は雪に溶けて
自分の鼓動が響いている

夜を泳ぐように過ごした
あの瞬間を
このスノードームみたいに
閉じ込められたら
見えない星に願いを込めて
音が無くなった夜に

体温で溶ける雪の結晶
触れることが出来ない
貴方は私の知らない時間の中にいる

凍える身体 力を抜いたら
震えが少し治った
でもそれは刹那 無意識のうちに
身体が強張っていく

こんな真っ白な世界の中にいたら
自分だけちょっと汚れてるみたい

今夜はきっと眠れない

時を奏でるように寄り添った
煌めきだとしても
目を閉じると望んでもいないのに

We stayed down for life, it's like a jingle to do 'em all
We too much involved to spend a single ounce of time
She bust a whole ounce by doin' lines
I had to leave, like the leaves do trees
I'm finally home, I wiped the stress, then I touched that sweat
We took 'em 35 to 1 like this shit roulette

Hold up, beg your pardon, we done lit up, baby
Set up, told the preacher, ""Never finish"", that's to say the least
Buy it, never lease it, but I gotta lease it
Mobile, Mona type of pieces, Met Gala, night Jesus
Skip it, hit the city, party pack, I got it with me
I'm shotty while I let you with me
I'm too bent to let you ride, barely 'til it's empty
Gotta feel me, pockets dumb fat and I got a skinny
Squad is with me, and that's everything I know about it

I know about it, I know about it, I know about it
I know about it, I know about it, I know about it
I know about it, I know about it, I know about it

Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least
You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week
Movin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet
We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah

Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck
City up, up, back to back
Fold up, fold up, fold up, trust

Like it thick with a bounce, we all in the count
Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with a wave
Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two and it's late, know the brown one is my fav'

Then Mike Brown gon' walk you out (gon' walk you out)
Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you might've left
I couldn't do none of this by myself

With MAFIA, they in the tuck
I gave you 50 to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, you rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, you rather go club
Know what to do, you rattle me up
Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages
Got a couple of vibrations
For the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration

Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked (me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)

Writin' songs about these people

That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow

I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
Woah, but that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?

Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog

So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime

Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial 9

Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger

I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancin' to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911

I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga... need to go and get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Weird ass nigga

I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker

Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago

Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro

I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow

I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
Woah, but that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?

Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog

So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

Are we still friends? I've got to kno-
Know
(If we can) see each other
Shake your hand, say hi
Long ago, long ago, long ago

I can't stop you, I can rock, too
I've been back there and I can, I got to
But I've got to know

Are we still friends? Can we be friends?

Don't get green skin (green skin), keep contact (keep contact)
Don't say, ""Goodbye, smell you later"" (later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end the season on a bad episode, nigga, nah

Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, from the way you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend

(Friends)
Are we still friends? (This can't end)
Are we still friends? (I still wanna say hi)
Are we, are we, are we, are we still friends?
Oh whoa

Can't say goodbye (yeah, ah, ah)
Can't say goodbye, goodbye (woo)",,,

We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence

I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace

I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy

Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh

It's my fault, you gon' leave lesson taught
See the weatherman told me that it was raining
My stupid ass brought umbrellas

I fuck 'round, and slow the beat down, and take the drums out,
And speed up my flow. I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow.
And I'm in need of a flow, may eat me a rapper, I might as well eat me a hoe.

I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin', and cold
As the devil, and demon, and ghost.

We all got our toes out, too
Call me when you get lost

I'ma travel the globe, you keep the block hot.
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurts.
Find us. We playing hide and seek with the passports.
Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us. Yeah,
The luggage is piling, I needed clothes to wear.
So many stinkies sit in my wallet, look like a folding chair.

The Cartier so light on my body, they thought I floated here,
We boated here. It's Tunechi and Tyler, but call me Baudelaire, yeah.
Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch again. We kissin', dawg,
I love when she lets me rubber like Michelin.
100 grand to sleep on the bird. The wings are whistlin' like...
Man, they ain't listening.
We crossed the line like immigrants and benefit from it.
Keep on stunting on these niggas,
Make 'em sick to their stomach. Man

Y'all don't understand. Fish so fresh you could taste the sand.
Yeah, we getting lost, but we know who we am.
Bada-bada-bada something-something-something.
Treat that last part like you niggas ain't saying nothing!

Yeah, haha
You see these excursions right here?
Just too lavish to post on the 'Gram (Gangsta Grillz)
Uh (Tunechi)

Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard at me.
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beefin'.
I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat.
Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me,
From y'all to me. Brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering.
I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet.
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me.
Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now.

Let's touch down, catch a beat down, like I catch touchdowns.
I fuck 'round, and slow the beat down, and take the drums out,
And speed up my flow. I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow.
And I'm in need of a flow, may eat me a rapper, I might as well eat me a hoe.

I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin', and cold
As the devil, and demon, and ghost.
I'ma get even and even get even some more.
It's too late to even get low. Bow!
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, that's what I need you to know.
Mula, Weezy, the GOAT.
The wind beneath my wings, Desert Eagle underneath my coat.
Yeah! Mula! Bitch

(Hot wind)

You see
We just over here admirin' the view of the mountains from the lake
Of course

I live life with no fear, except for the idea that one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well

I've got a plan, but the walking depends
If you can understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up 'cause I ain't-

I want to share last names, I want to be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin, spillin' feelin's, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for mask, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

It's not a joke, murder she wrote

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea that one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well

I've got a plan, but the walking depends
If you can understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up 'cause I ain't-

I want to share last names, I want to be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin, spillin' feelin's, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for mask, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

""Bring in the horns""

They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkins a faggot, please come and get me
Said I suckin' at your neck, like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, goddamn it, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigger

I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat (man...)
Cherry Bomb the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round

Damn, 'got to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
Well, when we ate, it was the steaks, now our section is great
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass him a plate
'Ye!

Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me?
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks but I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike

Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' (yeah)
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'

I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me, ""Are you still down?"" Yeah, my nigga
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they told they white daughters, ""Don't bring home Jerome""
I am the free nigga archetype (woo)
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon

It's funny, when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny (yeah)
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me (woo)
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (skrrrrt)

I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God
He said, ""I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard""

For your boy, I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room, damn (two, three, four)

Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction
Been exhausted, I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers
Hold your fuckin' ponies, my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely, I eat pussy like Shoney's, yeah (yeah)
It's Tunechi, homie, Master of Ceremonies
I knock 'em down, domino effect, no pepperoni, I swear

This them Golf boys, like them Hot Boys
For the nine-nine and 2000
But its the two-thou' and the one-four and the one-five
Yo, what up Wayne?
What up slime? Nigga, go hard

Yeah, I'ma go hard like before came
Got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad, and she give brain
That's that road head (yeah), this a dream car
Got a full tank of that same year I was born
That's that 1-9-9-1
'Nother nigga like I, you won't find one
'Cause nigga I'm a god, a divine one, Tune

My trigger finger wise but my nine dumb (yeah)
Middle finger blind, so it's fuck A-N-Y-one
Fuck, skate, and die son, a hundred ways to die, son
I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut, eat up
I stick my Rollie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda
Oh my goodness

Wayne, them bitches ugly
These niggas colder than Tommy buddy
Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel (black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling

Boy, let's get a scrimmage
And cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German
You bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow
And get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was

Fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot (ugh)
Son, you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchini, I know
It ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange

And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait, turn this up, bitch, this my jam (where the drums at?)

Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nigger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram and suplex her off a building if I get banned

Tamale, ah! Tamale, ah! Tamale, ah! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans bitch I'm on, your boy is bad to the bone

Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a Bimmer, E46
Have you heard 48? Motherfucker I'm great
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts from the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please

Fuck I look like? Got a new bike tire
Never popped like the pussy on a bitch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do, I go balls
Then I bust in her jaw like (fuck that disease)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now, turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus like ""You're going to jail now!""

Tamale, ah! Tamale, ah! Tamale, ah! Tamale
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans bitch I'm on, your boy is bad to the bone

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch suck dick, motherfuck you and your opinions (can you kick it?)
Yes, I can sir, where the lump is. sicker than the last bar bold-er
I'm a CO Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch I'm badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

Yeah buddy, this is my jam, na na na na na
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no fuck you, na na na na na
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?

A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little RedTube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me
Up and down, friction make a sound, shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing like-

Oh shit, aw (fuck)
What the fuck!
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, I'm sorry I just wanted some bangs
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office
Aw, fuck",,,

You pick a spot, I pick a tail number and we could be tourists (ooh, yeah)
Let's go to Cannes and watch a couple indie movies that you never heard of (baby)
Listen to bands, groove and we dance

Disco in France, smell some perfume, head in the wind (in the wind)
We can switch off
I can show you how you can really exfoliate skin
If you got a man, you should cut it off
Get your passport 'cause we runnin' off (run off)
We can sit and talk
You can tell me everything that's on your chest, baby, get it off

Your body compared to the fashion
I hope you ain't proud of the shit that I bought (baby)
